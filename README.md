## TODO

1. Add light / dark mode: https://nygaard.dev/blog/darkmode-react-tailwind
2. Use styled-components - check out this about styled-components https://styled-components.com/docs/tooling
3. Make navbar sticky
4. Implement `ScrollToTop` component and add it into Launches page
5. Ideally, remove as much inline style as possible
6. For all SpaceX **query** requests, select only useful fields
7. Set default height for all components to avoid shift when async data is being loaded
8. Implement launch view page
